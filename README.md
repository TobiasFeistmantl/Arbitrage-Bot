Ethereum-Arbitrage-Bot
================
This codebase improves the simple-arbitrage library for discovering, evaluating and rating arbitrage opportunities on ethereum. It is currently somewhat profitable, but may become progressively less so as the number of users increases. The reason for opening the source code is that I would like to get more suggestions, which would be very helpful!


Environment Variables
=====================
- **ETHEREUM_RPC_URL** - Ethereum RPC endpoint.

- **PRIVATE_KEY** - Private key for the Ethereum EOA that will be submitting Flashbots Ethereum transactions.

- **FLASHBOTS_RELAY_SIGNING_KEY** _[Optional, default: random]_ - Flashbots submissions require an Ethereum private key to sign transaction payloads. This newly-created account does not need to hold any funds or correlate to any on-chain activity, it just needs to be used across multiple Flashbots RPC requests to identify requests related to same searcher.

- **HEALTHCHECK_URL** _[Optional]_ - Health check URL, hit only after successfully submitting a bundle.

- **MINER_REWARD_PERCENTAGE** _[Optional, default 30]_ - 0 -> 100, what percentage of overall profitability to send to miner. After a month of use, 30 is a relatively balanced value.

Usage
======================

Make sure you have the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) environment on your device before you start using it.

1. Clone this repository

```bash

git clone  https://github.com/TobiasFeistmantl/Arbitrage-Bot

```

2. Go to the folder(Can be accessed manually)

```bash

cd arbitrage-bot

```

3. Install project dependencies

```bash

npm install

```

4. Configuring .env parameters

- Go to `.env.example` and fill in `PRIVATE_KEY` as the private key of your primary ethereum account in a format that starts with 0x, as in the example.(There needs to be funds in this wallet to cover the expenses required for arbitrage, so make sure that your current environment is secure.)

- The contract content is located in `/contracts/BundleExecutor.sol`, you can go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to deploy it and write the resulting contract address to the `BUNDLE_EXECUTOR_ADDRESS` parameter.

- Create a new Etherwallet for the `FLASHBOTS_RELAY_SIGNING_KEY` parameter and write the private key to it. (This wallet does not require any funds)

- `HEALTHCHECK_URL` Can be blank.

- `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL` For the RPC link you think is the fastest, you can use the default value.

- `MINER_REWARD_PERCENTAGE` You can use the default value or higher.

When all is done, change `.env.example` to `.env`.

5. start running

```bash

npm run start

```
